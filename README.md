#### Welcome to the official GitHub repository of The ModdedCity Project 'TMCP'

**TMCP** is a **Minecraft server** designed to be as <u>faithful as possible to the current world</u> without copying it. It's a **realistic RP server** that *is still in development* and welcomes both locals and passionate builders. We're planning an <u>**impressive** transportation system</u>, so we're calling on fans of trains and buses to build, drive, automate, and take them!

We also call on developers at all levels and in all domains to help out at any time.

We are always ready to welcome a new member to our team.

*We work on a volunteer basis*, of course, so please only do it for your own enjoyment and to help others.
